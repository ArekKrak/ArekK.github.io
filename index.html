                        <!-- Add details about the project -->
                        <strong>Problem:</strong> The objective of this project, the capstone project in one of the bootcamps I graduated from, was to write a program that encrypts messages. <br>
                        <strong>Action:</strong> The encryption method used in this program is based on the Caesar Cypher algorithm. The formula C = (P + K) % 26 was used to perform the actual encryption. The program was written using the ASCII character table.<br>
                        <strong>Success:</strong> The application is a contact form. Each field is encrypted once filled in and submitted.<br>
                        <strong>Technique:</strong> This application was written in Python, using Visual Studio Code.

                        <!-- Add details about the project -->
                        <strong>Problem:</strong> I wrote this application as one of my bootcamp capstone projects. The objective was to write a program that that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator. <br>
                        <strong>Action:</strong> This program was initially written using Python without GUI, it was initially a bunch of conditional and 'print' statements. As a result of the numerous upgrades it has gone through over time, it is now a Jupyter Notebook application. I used Tkinter 
                        library to add GUI - buttons, labels etc. I provided the user with the option to visualize the growth of investment over time in the form of a plot while using the Investment Calculator. The user chooses whether they want to view the plot, and if they agree, the window with 
                        the plot pops up - this upgrade was made possible with the import of 'matplotlib'. I also paid attention to error handling to make the app as robust as possible, using General Exception Handling, checking for 'None' types, etc. Improving, adding functionality to a program is 
                        something I enjoy, so the program is likely to undergo more changes in the future for an even better user's experience.<br>
                        <strong>Success:</strong> The application with its improved functionalities gives a user a range of choice. A user can either quickly calculate the final balance of an investment based on specific parameters, or calculate monthly repayments for a bond based on the house value and the like parameteres.<br>
                        <strong>Technique:</strong> This application was written in Python, using Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook.
